# DSL client - Scala

## Introduction

DSL client is a set of core Scala files used for interaction of DSL platform and Scala code.

If you are new to the DSL platform, take a look at [introduction] [3] and check out [the tutorials] [4]. 
You can even [try it online] [5] (but not in Scala).

## Installing

This package should primarily be used for testing. To setup DSL platform in an easy way, we recommend you to create and download a project from [dsl-platform.com][1]. 
For further information about using DSL platform in your projects, follow the instructions in the Setup guide.

## Running tests
